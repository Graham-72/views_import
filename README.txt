DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module provides an easy way to import previously exported Views definitions.

1. Export the views you wish to import and paste the export text into separate
   text files (name and extension not important).
2. Place the newly created text files in the /import subdirectory of this module.
3. Ensure all dependant modules are installed for the fields in the views.
4. Install this module.

The idea is that you could have a collection of commonly used views in a folder.
Then, when you start a project, copy the required views definitions into this
module and install.
